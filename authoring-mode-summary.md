# Authoring Mode Support Summary

## ✅ **YES - This will work with the existing panel container in authoring mode!**

The custom carousel component has been enhanced to fully support AEM's authoring experience with panel container functionality.

## How It Works

### 1. **Panel Container Integration**
- The component extends `core/wcm/components/carousel/v1/carousel` which includes built-in panel container support
- `cq:isContainer="{Boolean}true"` enables the container functionality
- Authors can drag and drop any allowed child components into the carousel

### 2. **Authoring vs. Preview Mode**

#### **In Authoring Mode:**
- 📝 Shows all carousel items in a **grid layout** for easy editing
- 🎯 Each slide is clearly labeled ("Slide 1", "Slide 2", etc.)
- 📋 Displays a **placeholder** when empty: "Drop components here to create carousel slides"
- 🖱️ Full drag-and-drop support for adding/reordering components
- 🚫 Navigation buttons and indicators are hidden (not needed for editing)

#### **In Preview/Publish Mode:**
- 🎠 Shows the **3-card carousel** with sliding functionality
- ⏯️ Navigation buttons work for slide-by-one movement
- 📱 Responsive behavior (3 cards → 2 cards → 1 card)
- 🔄 Smooth transitions and animations

### 3. **Complete File Structure**

```
